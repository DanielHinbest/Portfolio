                    description="My undergraduate thesis research addresses a critical gap in computer science education: the lack of adequate software testing skills among new graduates. Working with the Software Engineering & Education Lab (SEER Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Bradbury and Dr. Michael Miljanovic, I conducted a formal study examining how students approach software testing tasks. With approval from Ontario Tech University's Research Ethics Board, I collected and analyzed data from 59 students in CSCI 3060U - Software Quality Assurance during Winter 2025. The study included both surveys and hands-on testing activities that were monitored using IDE tracking software. Key findings revealed that students tend to focus heavily on code editing but often neglect consistent test executionâ€”an insight that could inform improvements in how testing is taught in undergraduate programs."
